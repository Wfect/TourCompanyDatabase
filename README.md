TourCompanyDatabase


This project is my Techcareer SQL Developer Bootcamp project that I participated in. In this project, a mssql database was created for the tour company.
The database created is a relational database. In this project, triggers, store procedures, functions etc. structures are used.

The database was created to hold data such as tours, tourists, guides and sales of a company operating in the tourism industry.
The created database provides company officials with information about tours, tourists, guides, etc. allowing them to analyze in detail recognizes.

Tables in Database:
Regions,
Tours,
Tourists,
Guides,
Users,
Sales,
Invoices.
